Outdoor insulators are crucial components in the transmission and distribution systems. Contaminated insulators, icing, water and pollution will cause less dielectric strength and further conductivity over the insulatorsâ€™ surface. To conduct a real-time evaluation of outdoor insulators, this study proposes a deep transfer learning-based image processing for the classification of insulator surface conditions. In particular, seven pre-trained networks are used to extract a variety of features from an image of the insulator surface. Then the extracted features are concatenated and used as input to a logistic regression classifier with l_1  regularization, which internally implements feature selection during the training process.
